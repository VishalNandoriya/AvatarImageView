Live rendering and expose the control’s properties in Interface Builder

In this tutorial we’ll look at how to create a custom ImageView, enable live rendering and expose the control’s properties in Interface Builder.

The @IBDesignable designation lets Interface Builder know that it should render the view directly in the canvas.

This allows seeing how your custom views will appear without building and running your app after each change.
